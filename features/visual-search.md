Visual search allows you to search for similar images based on visual content. Instead of relying on text-based keywords or metadata, you can search based on visual content like colors, shapes, textures and any other information that can be derived from the image itself.

By searching visually rather than by name or metadata, you can:

* Easily locate the images without needing to remember the tags or name of the file.
* Searching for Similar in your media library
* Identify duplicates in your media library at ease
* Discover images in your media library through visual characteristics
* Group visually similar images together for better organization
* Enhance discoverability of your assets

You can perform visual search from the dashboard either by text or  by image:

*   **Searching by Text** : Allows you to type in a word or a phrase to find images that visually match it. For example, you can type in `pink birds`, all the images that relate to `pink birds` will be retrieved from your media library\

*   **Searching by Image** : Allows you to find matches based on the image that you can upload.\

    For example, uploading the image from [the URL](https://ik.imagekit.io/pwliscd3n/photo-1491972690050-ba117db4dc09\_9\_0DBlXmS.jpeg) will retrieve images related to a woman wearing a red shirt with sunglasses\

*   **Searching by Image Url** : Allows you to find matches based on the image that you can upload.\

    \
    For example, entering [this URL](https://ik.imagekit.io/pwliscd3n/allison-huang-\_u8KhAZRGHs-unsplash\_rn6D9ksWC.jpg) in the input box will retrieve images related to a scenic view of beach with a house\

## Finding Similar Images to assets uploaded in Media Library

Using Visual Search, you can easily and quickly identify duplicate assets or find similar images in your media library\
\
This can be done directly from the File Details page in the Media Library

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/visual-search/file_details_page.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Use the "Find Similar" button to execute an Visual Search using image url.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/visual-search/similar_image_search.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The search results will include all images that match the context of the image you are trying to find similar ones to. As seen in the example above, the first couple of results will match be the duplicate results.

## Limitations

* Visual Search will only work on the following image types: jpeg, png, webp, gif, avif and svg
* Images larger than 25MB will not be included in the search results
* Images larger than 10MB cannnot be uploaded for "Search by Image". \
  However, you can run a search for images upto 25MB by searching by image url
