# Secure client side file upload (beta)

You can upload files to the ImageKit.io media library directly from the client-side in Javascript or any client side application using [JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication](secure-client-side-file-upload.md#json-web-token-jwt-generation-for-client-side-file-upload). You must implement a backed server to generate a JWT token to authenticate the request, as shown [here](secure-client-side-file-upload.md#backend-token-generation).

{% hint style="danger" %}
This API is in beta and subject to change.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**File size limit**\
The maximum upload file size is limited to 25MB on the free plan. On paid plan, this limit is 300MB for video files.

**Version limit**\
A file can have a maximum of 100 versions.

## Endpoint

| Method | Endpoint                                                                                         |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| POST   | [https://upload.imagekit.io/api/v2/files/upload](https://upload.imagekit.io/api/v2/files/upload) |

## Request structure (multipart/form-data)

The request structure is the same as the [server-side file upload API](./server-side-file-upload.md#request-structure-multipartform-data), except that to implement secure client-side upload, the application needs to pass a `token`, as explained below.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| <p><strong>token</strong><br>required</p> |<p>This is the client-generated JSON Web Token (JWT). The ImageKit.io server uses it to authenticate and check that the upload request parameters have not been tampered with after the generation of the token. Learn how to create the token below on the page.<br><br><strong>Note:</strong> Sending a JWT that has been used in the past will result in a validation error. Even if your previous request resulted in an error, you should always send a new token.</p><span data-gb-custom-inline data-tag="emoji" data-code="26a0">âš </span><strong>Warning:</strong> JWT must be generated on the server-side because it is generated using your account's private API key. This field is required for authentication when uploading a file from the client-side.</p>|

## Response code and structure (JSON)

Same as [server-side file upload API](./server-side-file-upload.md#response-code-and-structure-json).

## JSON Web Token (JWT) generation for client-side file upload

JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard [(RFC 7519)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. Your backend should ideally implement an API that should provide `token`. This is sent along with your upload request for authentication as well as validation of the integrity of upload parameters when using the upload API from the client side. Generating it requires your ImageKit.io [private API key](../api-introduction/api-keys.md#private-key), and hence this should be generated on your backend. Learn more about JSON Web Token [here](https://jwt.io/introduction).

JSON Web Token consist of three parts separated by dots-
- Header
- Payload
- Signature

<b>Header</b>

The header of the JSON Web Tokens consists of three parts: the `typ` of the token, which should be `JWT`, the signing algorithm, `alg`, being used, which is HMAC SHA256, and the `kid`, which is your ImageKit account's public key.

```javascript
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
  "kid": "your_public_key"
}
```

<b>Payload</b>

The payload is the token's second component. This should include all of the upload parameters that you intend to provide in your upload file request. All arguments except `file` and `token` can be included in this payload. In your upload API request, you must include the same set of parameters and their associated values along with the 'file' and 'token'. If there is a mismatch between upload request parameter and their values and the ones in the payload used to generate JWT, the upload request will fail.

The key in the payload should be the parameter name, and the value should be in stringified form. If you want to send the 'fileName' and 'useUniqueFileName' parameters, for example, the payload will be:

```javascript
{
  "fileName": "dress.jpg",
  "useUniqueFileName": "false" 
}
```

<b>Signature</b>

To create the signature you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, your ImageKit.io account's private key and sign that using the HMAC SHA256 algorithm.

```
HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY)
```

This is used to ensure that the payload was not altered along the route, as well as that the sender of the JWT is who they claim to be.

To create the JWT, the three outputs are transformed to Base64url strings and concatenated with periods (.). This JWT can then be used as a `token` in the upload API request.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Never publish your private key on client-side**
The Private API key should be kept confidential and only stored on your own servers.
{% endhint %}

### Backend token generation?

The client-side application sends an HTTP POST request to the backend and expects a JSON response having status code 200 containing the JWT in the `token` field.

The request body structure looks like this:

```javascript
{
    // The uploadPayload is the payload that you have to sign using your private key. It must contain all the parameters except 'file' and 'token' that you intend to send in the upload API request.
    "uploadPayload": {
        "fileName": "dress.jpg"
        "useUniqueFileName": "false",
        "tags": "summer,dress",
    },
    "expire": 400, // In seconds, must be less than one hour (3600 seconds)
    "publicKey": "your_public_key",
}
```

Response structure:

```javascript
{
    token: "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c",
}
```

Since calculating this parameter requires your ImageKit.io [private API key](../api-introduction/api-keys.md#private-key), hence this endpoint has to be implemented on your server-side. You can implement this endpoint in any language of your choice. Below is an example of how to implement this endpoint in Node.js using [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken).

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Node.js" %}
```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

const payload = req.body;
const token = jwt.sign(payload.uploadPayload, "your_private_key", {
    expiresIn: payload.expire,
    header: {
      alg: "HS256",
      typ: "JWT",
      kid: payload.publicKey,
    },
});
res.set({
    "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" : "*"
})
res.status(200);
res.send({ token });
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Secure client-side file upload example

The example below demonstrates only basic usage. Refer to [these examples](server-side-file-upload.md#examples) in the server-side upload section to learn about different use-cases. The only difference between client-side and server-side upload is how API authentication works.

Make sure you have implemented a backend service as shown [here](secure-client-side-file-upload.md#backend-token-generation) before using the below example.

{% tab title="jQuery (without SDK)" %}

        var formData = new FormData();
        formData.append("file", file.files[0]);
        formData.append("fileName", "abc.jpg");

        // Let's get the token from server side
        $.ajax({
            url : authenticationEndpoint,

            success : function(body) {

                // Now call ImageKit.io upload API v2
                $.ajax({
                    url : "https://upload.imagekit.io/api/v2/files/upload",

            },
            error : function(jqxhr, text, error) {
